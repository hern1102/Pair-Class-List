/*
Description: Linked List are linear data structures where the elements are not
stored in contiguous locations and every element is a separate object with a 
data part and address part. The elements are linked using pointers and 
addresses. Each element is known as a node. This LinkedList class is a 
generic Linked List that can be created with an empty list, or you can pass 
an object to be stored in the constructor as the first element in the list.
